## Features
- Real-time automated trading for forex, gold, and stocks.
- Advanced predictive modeling with a suite of ML and DL algorithms.
- Dynamic data visualization to track market trends.
- Scalable deployment on VPS for MT5 integration.
- Daily performance reports and strategy optimization.

## Data & Methodology
This project aggregates data from over 50 currency pairs, gold, and various stocks, totaling nearly 100,000 data points collected via MetaTrader5. The methodology includes:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering high-quality market data.
- **Preprocessing & Exploration**: Analyzing trends and correlations across currency pairs.
- **Correlation Fusion**: Combining data from highly correlated assets for enhanced predictions.
- **Deployment**: Running the system on a VPS to execute trades on MT5.

## Models & Workflow
A robust pipeline powers this project, featuring:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and cleaning raw data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Identifying common trends across currency pairs.
3. **Data Integration**: Merging correlated assets for robust modeling.
4. **Model Implementation**: Deploying a diverse set of algorithms:
   - Traditional ML: Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, CatBoost.
   - Deep Learning: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Transformer, CNN-LSTM, GRU, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).
5. **Model Filtering**: Eliminating low-accuracy models and those predicting significant losses.
6. **Ensemble Prediction**: Combining outputs from multiple models for optimal results.
7. **Post-Processing**: Adjusting bet ratios based on accuracy thresholds.
8. **Automation**: Deploying a self-running trading system with daily reports.

## Results
The models shine on test datasets, achieving:
- **Binary Classification**: Over 80% accuracy across 50+ currency pairs.
- **Ternary Classification**: 84% accuracy (up, down, sideways) on multi-label data.
These results highlight the project's potential for profitable, automated trading strategies.
